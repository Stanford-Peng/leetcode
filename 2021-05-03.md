    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        diff = 0
        for i in nums:
            diff ^= i

            else:
                res[1]^=i
        ## different nums goes to different positions with pairs of other numbers
        return res

### 2. Reverse Bits
[leetcode 190](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)
```
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int ret = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<32;i++){
            ret <<= 1;
            ret += (1&n);
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
