# Naming:
From 2022-08-14, all algorithm questions should be added to the corresponding file with correct topic such as Recursion.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, maintainers need to send a MR with at least one approval to add the new change to the main branch and more attentions should be given to the format and readability so that learners can eaily refresh their memory or something whey have learnt.<br>

Since most content is written in MD file, an markdown Vscode plug-in is suggested as well as git plug-in which can help you "Git blame" lol.
